This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is based on a wonderful little [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from the React folks.

I did change some things from the tutorial:  
* I converted the code to Typescript
* I added some testing.  Just one test, not particularly useful, but it was a way to understand how testing UI stuff might work.
